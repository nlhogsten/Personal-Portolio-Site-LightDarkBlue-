        <p class="bio-p">
            Wooden frames mounted on the back of the surfboard sculpture secure the pieces firmly in place and then was finished with a paint-resin mixture.
            The flag incorporates an impasto-like style with acrylic paint as the medium. 
            The goal of this work is to preserve the natural resources and labor behind the creation of these two shortboards.
            It is also meant to illuminate the sudden contempt our society casts on once such valuable objects when they are deemed "unuseful", where in this case contempt usually takes the form of a trash can.

        <h2 class="h2">Sustainability in the Surf Industry</h2>
        <p class="bio-p">
            The means of production of a single surfboard is immense - the materials, shipping, labor to shape the board, all the way to reaching the customers hands.
            All this effort only to end up snapped in half and thrown into a beachside trash can a few weeks after buying it. 
            This is a common sight at surf hotspots like the north shore of Oahu where professional surfers burn through 20+ boards a season.
            There are countless stories of surfers buying sparkling new surfboards and snapping them on their <i>very first</i> wave.
            The surfboard viewed through the lens of sustainability reveals it to be the epitome of an object that is completely <i>unsustainable</i>;
            a product lifespan so low to the point of being considered single use, full of toxic materials, a gem for marketers pushing lifestyle products and brands, and a highly consumptive vehicle accounting for large profits.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-p">
            This Hawai&#8216;i surfboard flag is meant to bring ideas to light about the unsustainable consumption and environmental impacts of surfing.
            It is also meant to inspire ideas in others about how society can rethink ideas about re-use.
            Almost every facet of modern life generates some sort of environmentally detrimental waste that pulls unreplentishable resources from somewhere in the world. 
        </p>
        <p class="bio-p">
            The Hawaiian flag is depicted on the scultpure to represent the prideful people of Hawai&#8216;i.
            The islands struggle with the proliferation of capitalist principles and exploitation are very apparent.
            This is evident within the sport of surfing itself where this proud Hawaiian tradition has become absorbed by mainstream corporate narratives.   
            Yet Hawai&#8216;i pride always persists in the face of this, not to mention other pervasive issues like skyrocketing housing and living costs, heavy reliance and mass importation from off islands entities, and environmental loss.
